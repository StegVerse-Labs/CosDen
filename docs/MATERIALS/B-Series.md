# B-Series: Optical Resin Infiltrants (Lumina™ Family)

## Overview
B-Series products are **in-office, light-cured, low-viscosity resins** carrying CosDen's Optical Enamel Matrix into enamel. They:

- Infiltrate enamel via capillary action
- Alter subsurface optics (brightness, opalescence, translucency)
- Lock nano-mineral structures in place
- Are cosmetic-only and non-diagnostic

---

## Core Resin Chemistry

- Base monomers: TEGDMA (70–85%), UDMA (10–25%)
- Nano-particles:
  - Nano-hydroxyapatite: 5–10%
  - Nano-silica: 1–2.5%
  - Optional fluorapatite: 0.5–1%
  - Optional ACP: 0.5–1%
- Photoinitiators:
  - Camphorquinone (CQ)
  - TPO-type for deep, low-yellow cure
- Surfactants: phosphate-ester, PEG-silane (dispersion)

## Products

### B1 LuminaFlow™
**Goal:** Clear, penetrating infiltrant for general brightening and stain masking.

- Focus on clarity + infiltration depth
- Minimal opalescence
- Ideal baseline cosmetic infiltrant

---

### B2 LuminaOpal™
**Goal:** Add opalescence + high-angle light scatter.

- Adds nano-titania (~0.1–0.3%) for subtle blue/UV scatter
- Increased nano-silica (2–2.5%)
- Enhanced fluorapatite (~1%)

**Effect:** Veneer-like shimmer and “live” enamel appearance.

---

### B3 LuminaDual™ (Two-Step System)
**Step 1:** Deep penetration resin  
**Step 2:** Higher-scatter surface resin

**Goal:** Maximal brightness + depth + surface gloss.

---

### B4 LuminaUltra™ (Future Concept)
**Goal:** Longest-lasting cosmetic infiltration with extreme optical stability.

- Optimized resin network for UV/color stability
- Advanced particle coatings for long-term appearance
